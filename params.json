{"name":"Passcoder","tagline":"jQuery plugin for making passcode inputs","body":"Passcoder\r\n=========\r\n\r\nGetting started with Passcoder\r\n---------\r\n\r\nGrab a copy of `passcoder.js` or `passcoder.min.js` and include it in your page after jQuery. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nUsing Passcoder\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAny textual input can be Passcoded. When an input becomes passcoded, it retains the original size of the input field. If you have an input that is 150px, the resulting passcoded input (including margins and paddings) will span the same 150px.  \r\n  \r\nTo passcode an input field, simply call  \r\n\r\n`$('.myInputField').passcode();`  \r\n  \r\nThis will use the default values for passcoder. This will make 4 input boxes, and a margin (left and right) of 5px for every input.\r\n\r\nOveriding Defaults\r\n---------\r\n\r\nTo call passcoder to use more or less inputs, or put more distance between the inputs, simply call passcoder like this:\r\n  \r\n    $('.myInputField').passcode({  \r\n        characters: 5,  \r\n        margin: 10  \r\n    });\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
